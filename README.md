This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for sentiment analysis of game reviews and recommend games based on these reviews. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we analyze the sentiment expressed in user reviews to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

This readme provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up and running the application, as well as additional information about its features and implementation.

## Features

2. **Game Database:** The system includes a comprehensive database of games, including information such as title, genre, description, release date, and user ratings. The database serves as the foundation for generating recommendations.

3. **User Preferences:** Users can input their gaming preferences like genre, category and also developer company. This information helps in generating accurate recommendations tailored to their interests.

4. **Recommendation Engine:** The core of the system is the recommendation engine, which utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and generate personalized game recommendations. The engine takes into account user preferences, game ratings, and collaborative filtering techniques to provide accurate suggestions.

5. **Rating and Feedback:** Games are rated based on user reviews and the best games are displayed first in the list of recommended games.
