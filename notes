1. Start tokenizing
2. tokenize punctuation marks as individual tokens,including comma,question,exclamation,full stop.
3. Notice that sometimes there isn't correct spacing like in this ->
   There is a cat,who eats mouse.Which is not good!Thus should avoid.
   Here "cat,who" , "mouse.Which" "good!Thus" taken one word by tokenizer ,we want them separate.
4. clitics "I'm" -> "I am" should be two words, in tokenized format
   Possesive Appostrophe remain same ,no changes
   apostrophe ending s -> apostrophe same
5. #abc is one token
6. U. S. A is one token -> U.S.A
7. All dates will be in format CF:D:yyyy-mm-dd including "07/07/13" , 
   “07-07-13”, “7th July 13” and “2013-07-07”.
   
   "july'13" -> "CF:D:yyyy-mm"
   only "2013" ->“CF:D:yyyy”
   only july -> “CF:D:????-07”
8. Time will be in canonical format.
   "7PM" -> "CF:T:1900"
