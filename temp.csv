1721470,"game is good, devs are not",,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,the game looks really cool but i'm colorblind so i can't even leave the reception :),,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,"Game is very well made. I recommend this to those who love a horror game with puzzles mixed into it.Just you know, if you're gonna charge 4.99$ for each chapter,make them longer.But overall,It's a good game, Got scared a couple times even when i was expecting it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,big blue  man trying to touch me,,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,I spent 5 dollars for this game when it came out and now it's free and the new chapter cost 10$ Mob games should give 5 dollars off on the new chapter for anyone who bought the first one.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1721470,big blue man trying to touch me,,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,The game is extremely short. It can range from 20 minutes to infinity depending on how long you spend pacing back and forth trying to convince yourself that the dark abyss mustn't be the way to go (it was and fml i wasn't ready). This is the second horror game ever to get a genuine reaction out of me after visage (screw that game) and i will be playing every future chapter that comes out after this because for some reason i like giving myself heart problems.Maybe I'm a masochist.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,i would get this game one of the best horror games i have played but i think chapter one is to short,,,,,,,,,,,,

1721470,"Great game, a horror game the actually scared me for once!",,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,This game reminds me that I am mentally ill,,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,"My brother bought me this game, just to watch me die a little inside as I played it. It was pretty fun, except the feeling of always needing to watch your back. Only I don't suggest looking backwards when poppy is behind you. Just run while you cry.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,"The game isn't bad, as it stands now, there is only one chapter and it alone is really well made, enough to scare the shit out of most. Really nice stuff. However, I have a big problem with this game, more specifically the dev team behind it because as of now, they've released a set of video NFTs that cost WAY MORE than the game itself to create some kind of treasure hunt, remember those we had back when Scott Cawthon was making new FNAF games? Basically that but the execution is fucking awful. You need to buy a bunch of videos to piece together the evidence but you only get the final one if you pay for all of the other ones. NFTs do not belong in gaming, specially not like this. So basically, the game is pretty good but I don't trust the devs. Ended up refunding since I don't support NFTs in the slightest.Edit: There has also been a confirmation that they basically stole creative property from the guy that made Venge. It's on Steam, and it's apparently a game way better than Poppy. There are some videos on YT talking more about that.Edit 2: LMAO they made the game free",,,,,,,,,,,,
1721470,I PAID FIVE DOLLORS AND NOW ITS FREE AND I DON'T GET IT BACK but good game,,,,,,,,,,,,
